# resumable_dijkstra
This project presents a class resumable_dijkstra that makes use of the concepts of Boost Graph Library but has the distinctive quality that it can be used to pause and resume the computation. 

The solutions offered in this repository are not as neat and efficient as the more recent solution of using coroutines in the visitor pattern. See the discussion here: http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2016/01/85591.php
